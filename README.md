# Human Background Remover

This project is a web application that allows users to upload images, remove the background using machine learning, and download the processed image with a transparent background in PNG format.

## Features
- Upload an image and remove its background.
- Download the processed image with a transparent background.
- Preview both the original and the background-removed images.
- Supports PNG download for easy integration into other applications.

## How It Works
The application uses [Mediapipe](https://mediapipe.dev) for human segmentation and OpenCV to process the image and remove the background. 

### Steps:
1. The user uploads an image.
2. The app processes the image using Mediapipeâ€™s segmentation model to detect the human figure.
3. The background is removed and replaced with transparency (alpha channel).
4. The user can download the image in PNG format.
